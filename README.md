## CSRF
# This is a simulation of how a CSRF Cybertheft would occur if there is no built-in protection. The banking website with the 8000 port number is just like most monetary transferring website, where each user's information is stored on a secure database, the server automatically saves a session during a login, enter the sender/receipient/transaction type/amount/banking institution, and click send.

# Since hidden forms are used here, nothing from the bank website will show up here. Once the user is logged in on the bank website, this hacker website will steal the session from there, and it will process anything it's intended for with one click from the user.
